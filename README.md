# Kiwicon Intro to Badge Hacking

This repo is to host the instructions and code for the Kiwicon 2038 Intro to Badge Hacking course (https://www.kiwicon.org/the-con/training/intro-to-badge-hacking/).

## Welcome!

First up, welcome to the course :D

I hope that today is enjoyable and that you leave having gained skills and knowledge you can put to good use.

Learning the basics of electronics is a great skill. You may use this in the future to deconstructe IOT devices, build your own tools, or simply to fix a broken gadget. When combined with basic programming skills, this can take on a whole new level, where your imagination and, usually more importantly, budget are the only limits!

In particular, learning about how microcontrollers work is a great asset. This gives you the fundamentals for learning about more complex computers and systems. Note that, these days, a computer isn't really a single entity, it is a whole ecosystem of various smaller microcontrollers doing all sorts of functions. Your laptops itself likely has several dozen 'computers' in it, the CPU, GPU, controllers for the keyboard, touchpad, webcam, touchbar, SSD, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth... not to mention dongles. It's a great time to get a better understanding of how all these components can interact, particularly in light of recent events!

There is no fixed timeline to today. I have broken everything down into labs which we will move through, but feel free to go at your own pace! The only aim that I have for you today is to leave with a completed, working badge. So take time to make sure you understand everything and get the most out of it. If you race through everything, take the time to help out those around you or come up with some new idea you can program the badge to do, it's up to you.

Happy hacking!

## Safety / Conduct

+ In the event of a fire, leave all your gear and follow the exit signs out of the building.
+ In the event of an earthquake, go under your table. When the shaking stops, egress the building following the exit signs, and move to clear ground (up near parliament).
+ We will be working with toxic elements, i.e. lead (PB), in the solder. Do not ingest the solder and make sure you wash your hands before eating anything.
+ The solder flux may be irritating to some. If you have an issue, move to one of the tables / stations nearer the windows.
+ Soldering irons are hot! Always beware where you are putting it and make sure the cord is in a safe location where noone can trip over it.
+ If you see any hazards, let me know and we will work to minimise or remedy these.
+ We follow the [Kiwicon Code of Conduct](https://www.kiwicon.org/faq/#q9). Don't be a shitweasel! We're here to learn in a collaborative environment. Leave everything else at the door.

## Breaks / Facilities

+ Please note this is a working environment. Please keep noise down outside the conference room!
+ There is cans of Sprite in the fridge, water in the tap.
+ Toilets are in the stairwells, female toilets are to the left just outside the door, males to the left on the other side of the single lift. Ask for an access card before you leave, as the stairwell doors are locked. If you get locked out without a card, go to the ground floor and take the lift back up to level 4.
+ We will take regular breaks, but if you have something to do, feel free to bounce in and out as needed.

## Course Labs

After that, if anyone is interested, we can run through PCB design using Eagle (and maybe Fritzing).
